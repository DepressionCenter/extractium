Summary: The local page: a small web page, served by the tool itself on
this machine only, for setting up and changing a build's settings
without a terminal. `server` is the HTTP server behind `extractium ui`,
`settings` reads and writes the settings file for the page's form, and
`static/` holds the page's own files.

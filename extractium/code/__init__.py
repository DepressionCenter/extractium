"""
Summary: Lightweight static analysis of source code. Reads a repository's
files with Tree-sitter, falls back to Universal Ctags where no grammar
exists, and records what each file defines, imports, and calls. Nothing
here executes, compiles, or installs anything a repository contains.
See docs/github-repository-indexing.md.
